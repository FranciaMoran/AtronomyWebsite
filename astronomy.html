	<h1>Astronomical Event Tracker</h1>
		<p id="intro-paragraph">Are you interested in Astronomy and the infrequent events in the sky only visible periodically? Well this website is for you! (Those who answered yes). This website provides count downs to different events including upcomming eclipses, meteors, and other events. Hopefully this  website successfully consolidates events so that the user can easily see what will be visible to them when and where.</p>
	<h2>Meteor Showers</h2>

	<p id="paragraph">Meteor Showers are celestial events in which meteoroids enter the Earth's atmosphere at high speeds and on parallel paths causing brief bright streaks in the sky. Although there are frequently meteor showers with low numbers of meteors per hour, there are brighter ones that happen throughout the year at predictable times. I have compiled eleven famous meteor showers known for being bright. Additionally it is worth noting that I included the lower numbers of recorded meteors per hour. When there is an exceptional amount of meteoroids (and if the sky is nice and clear) there can be as many as hundreds per hour. Finally I will mention as well that these meteor showers should be able to be viewed from wither hemisphere but sometimes the north or south is preferable based on the trajectory of the meteoroids. </p>
